#lcdLSTM

What is your idea?

lcdLSTM is a text generator using the lyrics corpus from LCD Soundsytem songs.  

What did you implement so far?

This project uses a Keras model on a python server to analyze text and generate the following characters based on seeded words. Everything is then previewed and displayed using P5.js 

What did you learn / what are your next steps? 

The text corpus isn't large enough to produce anything sensible passed the 40 characters. TODO: Keep training on a larger text corpus
