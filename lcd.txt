"Daft Punk Is Playing At My House"

Daft Punk is playing at my house, my house
I'll show you the ropes, kid, show you the ropes
Got a bus and a trailer at my house, my house
I'll show you the ropes kid, show you the ropes
I bought fifteen cases for my house, my house
All the furniture is in the garage
Well daft punk is playing at my house, my house
You got to set them up kid, set them up

You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah [x2]
You got the set them up, set them up

You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah [x2]
You got the set them up, set them up

Well Daft Punk is playing at my house, my house
I waited for 7 years and 15 days
There's every kid for miles at my house, my house
And the neighbors can't...call the police 
There's a fist fight brewin' at my house, my house 
Because the jocks can't...get in the door 
When Daft Punk is playing at my house, my house
You got to set them up kid, set them up

You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah [x2]
You got the set them up, set them up

You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah [x2]
You got the set them up, set them up

[Cow bell solo]

Well everybody's lined up in my house, my house
And Sarah's girlfriend is working the door
Got everybody's PA in my house, my house
All the robots descend from the bus
There's a freak out brewing in my house, my house
In the basement
'Cause Daft Punk is playing at my house, my house
You got to set them up kid, set them up

You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah [x2]
You got the set them up, set them up

You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah [x2]
You got the set them up, set them up

And never, never let them go
No never, never, never let them go
Never, never, never let them go
Let them go

"Too Much Love"

What will you say when the day comes
When it's no fun
When it's all done
When it's no fun

What will you say when the time comes
There's a dry run when it's undone
And there's no one

When it's too much love
Too much love
Too much
It's too much love
Too much love
Too much

What will you do when you wake up
Fatten you up
Fasten you up
Fatten you up

No memories to get cloudy
To get cloudy when you can't see
What you can't see

It's all the same when it's morning
And you're boring
Still ignoring everything

No memories to remind you
Of the old you
Nothing for it
Just keep it up, keep it up

When it's too much love
Too much love
Too much
When it's too much love
Too much love
Too much

What will you say when the day comes
When it's no fun
When it's all done
When it's undone

What will you say when the time comes
There's a dry run when it's undone
And it's undone

When it's too much love
Too much love
Too much
It's too much love
Too much love
Too much

What will you do when you wake up
Fatten you up
Fasten you up
Fatten you up

No memories to get cloudy
To get cloudy when you can't see
What you can't see

It's all the same when it's morning
And you're boring
Still ignoring everything

No memories to remind you
Of the old you
Nothing for it
Just keep it up, keep it up

When it's too much love
Too much love
Too much
When it's too much love
Too much love
Too much

With no memory
With no memory
With no memory
To keep you up at night


"Tribulations"

Everybody makes mistakes,
But I feel alright when I come undone
You're not not making me wait, 
But it seems alright as long as something's happening

I try to make you late,
But you fight me out like a fire does
You try making me wait, 
But it feels alright as long as something's happening. 

Get your payments from the nation
For your trials and tribulations

You try to make me wait
You come around when it's come undone
Everybody makes you late, 
And it's never you, because you're always thinkin'
I try making you wait, 
And you give me some like you give it good
Everybody makes mistakes, 
But it seems it's mine that always keep on stingin'

Get your payments from the nation
For your trial and tribulations
Get your payments from the nation 
For your trial and tribulations

You try making me wait, 
But you come undone when you come undone
Everybody makes mistakes, 
But it's always mine that seem to keep on stickin'

Get your payments from the nation, for your trials and tribulations
Get your payments from the nation, for your trials and tribulations
Get your payments from the nation, for your trials and tribulations
Get your payments from the nation, for your trials and tribulations
Get your payments from the nation, for your trials and tribulations

"Movement"

It's like a movement from the small place
To a bigger city
Or it's a bigger bag to strap the ego of a little baby
It's like a discipline without the discipline of
All of the discipline
It's like a culture
Without the effort of all the culture

Oh but I'm tapped
You're pillaging and I'm tapped
You're yesterday
And I'm tapped
Another reason I'm tapped

It's like a movement
Without the bother of all of the meaning
It's like a discipline
Without the discipline of all of the discipline
It's like a fat guy in a t-shirt
Doing all the saying
It's like a couple dads and a few friends
Trying hard to stay in

You're history and I'm tapped
You're fast and easy and I'm tapped
You're pillaging
And I'm tapped
For best results well I'm tapped

Here comes the report nothing to report see
It's all the same
It seems the punk rock as an experiment well
It pulled up lame
You got the fat guy in the t-shirt
Doing all the singing
Straight to the drunk tank doing the research
Doing all the blame

You're history and I'm tapped
You're fast asleep and I'm tapped
You're pillaging and I'm tapped
For best results well I'm tapped

It's like the culture
Without the effort or all of the luggage
It's like a discipline
Without the discipline of all of the discipline
It's like a movement
Without the bother of the meaning
It's like a culture
Without the culture of all of the culture

You're history and I'm tapped
You're fast and easy
And I'm tapped
You're pillaging and I'm tapped
And you're finicky so I'm tapped

"Never As Tired As When I'm Waking Up"


Wasted and complacent
And you about the same
But still I want to get it
On with you tonight
When I was a little boy
I laid down in the grass
I'm sure you'd feel the same if I
Could fuck you here tonight

But I'm never as tired as when I'm waking up
I'm never as tired as when I'm waking up
But it feels like I'm in love again
No it feels like I'm in love again
Though it feels like I'm in love again
With what you do

If we made it happen
I'm sure what we would do
Run outside and fuck someone
To show it didn't mean a thing
Seems it could be simple
If I could just grow up
Never gonna get it now
Cause I'll never grow

But I'm never as tired as when I'm waking up
I'm never as tired as when I'm waking up
But it feels like I'm in love again
No it feels like I'm in love again
Though it feels like I'm in love again
With what you do

But not with you
(Keep on telling myself it's true)
But not with you
(Keep on telling myself it's true)
But not with you
(Keep on telling myself it's true)
But not with you
(Keep on telling myself it's true)
But not with you
(Keep on telling myself it's true)
But not with you
(Just keep on telling myself it's true)
But not with you
(Just keep on telling myself it's true)
But not with you
(Just keep on telling myself it's true)


"On Repeat"


Beats on repeat, beating on me
From every car in the street
There's a constant repeat, on repeat
Of your paranoid, heartbreaking beats
On repeat

It's a five song repeat, beating on me
With your favourite band, that helps you sleep
And here comes the new stylish creep
From every car in the street
On repeat
On repeat

Don't tell nobody what, what you really want because
They can tell everybody else
What you really want
Then you're fucked, so
Act like it's for yourself or its all yours
And they go and tell everybody else
That you're really great
We are just people

You're enfranchised and entranced
You're enfranchised and entrenched
But know that it's yours
Real life's a compromise

But your beats half-assed streak is beating on me
Well, my drunken week is helping me sleep

I wish I could complain more about the rich but then
All their children would line the streets,
Come to every show,
No one wants that

I wish I could complain more about the rich but then
All their children would flee the schools,
Come to every show,
Drugged and unwashed

I wish I could complain more about the rich but then
All their children would line the streets,
Come to every show,
Unwashed and drugged and

"Great Release"

And it feels like it won't come on
And it takes like you're full of love
Still the time never to pay on
Still the time never to pay on

And it feels like I'm coming home
And it's still like a merry cow
And it feels like it's coming home
And it feels like it's full of love
Still in time is the great release
Something dying will be a great release

"Losing My Edge"

Yeah, I'm losing my edge.
I'm losing my edge.
The kids are coming up from behind.
I'm losing my edge.
I'm losing my edge to the kids from France and from London.
But I was there.

I was there in 1968. 
I was there at the first Can show in Cologne.
I'm losing my edge.
I'm losing my edge to the kids whose footsteps I hear when they get on the decks.
I'm losing my edge to the Internet seekers who can tell me every member of every good group from 1962 to 1978.
I'm losing my edge.

To all the kids in Tokyo and Berlin.
I'm losing my edge to the art-school Brooklynites in little jackets and borrowed nostalgia for the unremembered eighties.

But I'm losing my edge.
I'm losing my edge, but I was there.
I was there.
But I was there.

I'm losing my edge.
I'm losing my edge.
I can hear the footsteps every night on the decks.
But I was there.
I was there in 1974 at the first Suicide practices in a loft in New York City.
I was working on the organ sounds with much patience.
I was there when Captain Beefheart started up his first band.
I told him, "Don't do it that way. You'll never make a dime."
I was there.
I was the first guy playing Daft Punk to the rock kids.
I played it at CBGB's.
Everybody thought I was crazy.
We all know.
I was there.
I was there.
I've never been wrong.

I used to work in the record store. 
I had everything before anyone.
I was there in the Paradise Garage DJ booth with Larry Levan.
I was there in Jamaica during the great sound clashes.
I woke up naked on the beach in Ibiza in 1988.

But I'm losing my edge to better-looking people with better ideas and more talent.
And they're actually really, really nice.

I'm losing my edge.

I heard you have a compilation of every good song ever done by anybody.
Every great song by the Beach Boys. All the underground hits.
All the Modern Lovers tracks. I heard you have a vinyl of every Niagra record on German import.
I heard that you have a white label of every seminal Detroit techno hit - 1985, '86, '87.
I heard that you have a CD compilation of every good '60s cut and another box set from the '70s.

I hear you're buying a synthesizer and an arpeggiator and are throwing your computer out the window because you want to make something real. You want to make a Yaz record.

I hear that you and your band have sold your guitars and bought turntables. 
I hear that you and your band have sold your turntables and bought guitars.

I hear everybody that you know is more relevant than everybody that I know.

But have you seen my records?

Joy Division, Lower 48, the Association, Sun Ra, 
Scientists, Royal Trux, 10cc,

You don't know what you really want. [x15]

"Get Innocuous!"

Home - home in the late-night
And away - away in the half-life
Except saturday - crushed by the boring
Until played and plagued by the tourists again

When once you had believed it
Now you see it's sucking you in

To string you along with the pretense
And pave the way for the coming release

Alone and prone in the half-light
And late- late to the real-life
If you will find a way into the gold rush
You will stay until the morning comes
You can normalize
Don't it make you feel alive

"Time To Get Away"

Its time to get away, its time to get away from you
Its time to get away, its time to get away from you
You brought a lot of money
But me, I got a tiny tummy
And you, you make me sleep
I try and try
But you're under my knee
And I start to be sensible (if you know what I mean)
And so its time to get away, Its time to get away from you
I'm dying to get away, I'm dying to get away
Next time we'll talk it over
And we can start again
For you, I caught a lot of static
And me, I would like it automatic
Ah-what what what what what did you think would happen next?
Ah-what what what what what could it ever be?
Though its time to get away, its time to get away from you
I'm dying to get away, I'm dying to get away
Next time let's talk about it
And maybe start again
To think I used to pity you
To think I used to pity you, it's true
To think I used to pity you
To think I used to talk to you, it's true
Next time we can talk about it
Or even start again
I couldn't tell you what you wanted
(You know what I'm saying?) I knew you were low man,
But the truth is I was shocked
(Of) power eyes, eyes never lie
Kids, Kids never lie.

"North American Scum"

Oh oh oh
Oh I don't know, I don't know, oh, where to begin
We are north americans
And for those of you who still think we're from england
We're not, no.
We build our planes and our trains till we think we might die,
Far from North America,
Where the buildings are old and you might have lots of mimes.
Aha, oh, oh.
I hate the feelin' when you're looking at me that way
Cause we're north americans
But if we act all shy, it'll make it ok
Makes it go away.

Oh I don't know, I don't know, oh, where to begin
When we're north american
But in the end we make the same mistakes all over again
Come on north americans

We are north american scum
We're from north america

And all the kids all the kids that want to make the scene
Here in north america
When our young kids get to read it in your magazines
We don't have those
So where's the love where's the love where's the love where's the love where's the love tonight?
But there's no love man there's no love and the kids are uptight
So throw a party till the cops come in and bust it up
Let's go north americans
Oh you were planning it I didn't mean to interrupt
Sorry
I did it once and my parents got pretty upset
Freaked out in north america
But then I said the more I do it the better it gets

Let's rock north america

We are north american scum
We're from north america
We are north american scum
We are north american

New york's the greatest if you get someone to pay the rent
Wahoo north america
And it's the furthest you can live from the government un huh huh
Some proud american christians might disagree
Here in north america
But new york's the only place we're keepin them off the street
Boo boo now we can't have parties like in spain where they go all night
Shut down in north america
Or like berlin where they go another night, alright, un huh un huh

You see I love this place that I have grown to know
Alright, north america.
And yeah, I know you wouldn't touch us with a ten-foot pole
'cause we're north americans.

We love north america

Take me back to the states man
North american scum
Where we can be all we want if we really ??
North american
Where the dj gigs are as fun
Here in north american scum
Don't blame the canadians
Let go north america

"Someone Great"

I wish that we could talk about it,
But there, that's the problem.
With someone new I couldn't start it,
Too late, for beginnings.
The little things that made me nervous,
Are gone, in a moment.
I miss the way we used to argue,
Locked, in your basement.

I wake up and the phone is ringing,
Surprised, as it's early.
And that should be the perfect warning,
That something's, a problem.
To tell the truth I saw it coming,
The way, you were breathing.
But nothing can prepare you for it,
The voice, on the other, end.

The worst is all the lovely weather,
I'm stunned, it's not raining.
The coffee isn't even bitter,
Because, what's the difference?
There's all the work that needs to be done,
It's late, for revision.
There's all the time and all the planning,
And songs, to be finished.

And it keeps coming,
And it keeps coming,
And it keeps coming, 
Till the day it stops
[x3]
And it keeps coming,
[x7]
Till the day it stops.

I wish that we could talk about it,
But there, that's the problem.
With someone new I could have started,
Too late, for beginnings.
You're smaller than my wife imagined,
Surprised, you were human.
There shouldn't be this ring of silence,
But what, are the options?

When someone great is gone.
[x8]

We're safe, for the moment.
Saved, 
For the moment.

"All My Friends"

That's how it starts
We go back to your house
We check the charts
And start to figure it out

And if it's crowded, all the better
Because we know we're gonna be up late
But if you're worried about the weather
Then you picked the wrong place to stay
That's how it starts

And so it starts
You switch the engine on
We set controls for the heart of the sun
One of the ways we show our age

And if the sun comes up, if the sun comes up, if the sun comes up
And I still don't wanna stagger home
Then it's the memory of our betters
That are keeping us on our feet

You spent the first five years trying to get with the plan
And the next five years trying to be with your friends again

You're talking 45 turns just as fast as you can
Yeah, I know it gets tired, but it's better when we pretend

It comes apart
The way it does in bad films
Except in parts
When the moral kicks in

Though when we're running out of the drugs
And the conversation's winding away
I wouldn't trade one stupid decision
For another five years of life

You drop the first ten years just as fast as you can
And the next ten people who are trying to be polite
When you're blowing eighty-five days in the middle of France
Yeah, I know it gets tired only where are your friends tonight?

And to tell the truth
Oh, this could be the last time
So here we go
Like a sales force into the night

And if I made a fool, if I made a fool, if I made a fool
On the road, there's always this
And if I'm sued into submission
I can still come home to this

And with a face like a dad and a laughable stand
You can sleep on the plane or review what you said
When you're drunk and the kids look impossibly tan
You think over and over, "hey, I'm finally dead."

Oh, if the trip and the plan come apart in your hand
You can turn it on yourself you ridiculous clown
You forgot what you meant when you read what you said
And you always knew you were tired, but then
Where are your friends tonight?

Where are your friends tonight?
Where are your friends tonight?

If I could see all my friends tonight
If I could see all my friends tonight
If I could see all my friends tonight
If I could see all my friends tonight

"Watch The Tapes"

Read all the pamphlets and watch the tapes
I get all confused when you mix up the dates....
Woah!

Don't gimme the pretend you come for the weekend
And you stay for the week
You say that you hate it but that's how you made it
Just keep it oblique
We're both high high high, high high on lemon sips
We're all suh-suh-suh sucked-in-by parlour tricks

Oh the people deceive you the kids never leave
Cuz you make them at home
You try to appease them and they show you the stick
But still you pick up the phone
But hey man, you can take it
As long as they don't shove you out in the cold
It's not getting better, no it's not getting better, man
It's just getting old
Ah ooh! we do what we're programmed to do--
Hey we do what we're told

I never remember to carry my book when I get on the bus
You never forget it's your time to collect
When they are making a fuss
We're both high high high, high high on lemon sips
We're all high high high, high high on wiggling hips
Ah ooh! you break off your plans for the weekend
And ah oh! you can tell them the dates
But that don't mean they're letting you go

Don't gimme the pretend you come for the weekend
And you stay for the year
Avoid all the plans cuz we're making our day jobs
Into a steady career
We're both high high high, high high on lemon sips
We all claw claw claw, cli-climb-on to sinking ships
And ah ooh! avoid all the cold sideways glances
And ah ooh! celebrate! celebrate! celebrate!
And then turn to stone

Read all the pamphlets and watch the tapes
You turn 25 and now you're all out of escapes
C'mon

Hey the rock writer told me to tell you:
"though you're great and you're brave
You still lack that which makes you a star."
Read all the pamphlets and watch the tapes
We all get a little drunk and then we act like apes
Ow!

"Sound Of Silver"

Sound of silver talk to me
Makes you want to feel like a teenager
Until you remember the feelings of
A real life emotional teenager
Then you think again

"New York, I Love You But You're Bringing Me Down"

New York, I Love You
But you're bringing me down

New York, I Love You
But you're bringing me down

Like a rat in a cage
Pulling minimum wage

New York, I Love You
But you're bringing me down

New York, you're safer
And you're wasting my time

Our records all show
You are filthy but fine

But they shuttered your stores
When you opened the doors
To the cops who were bored
Once they'd run out of crime

New York, you're perfect
Don't please don't change a thing

Your mild billionaire mayor's
Now convinced he's a king

So the boring collect
I mean all disrespect

In the neighborhood bars
I'd once dreamed I would drink

New York, I Love You
But you're freaking me out

There's a ton of the twist
But we're fresh out of shout

Like a death in the hall
That you hear through your wall

New York, I Love You
But you're freaking me out

New York, I Love You
But you're bringing me down

New York, I Love You
But you're bringing me down

Like a death of the heart
Jesus, where do I start?

But you're still the one pool
Where I'd happily drown

And oh.. Take me off your mailing list
For kids that think it still exists
Yes, for those who think it still exists

Maybe I'm wrong
And maybe you're right
Maybe I'm wrong
And maybe you're right

Maybe you're right
Maybe I'm wrong
And just maybe you're right

And Oh..
Maybe mother told you true
And they're always be something there for you
And you'll never be alone

But maybe she's wrong
And maybe I'm right
And just maybe she's wrong

Maybe she's wrong
And maybe I'm right
And if so, is there?

"Dance Yrself Clean"

Walking up to me expecting walking up to me
Expecting words it happens all the time
Present company excepted present company
Except the worst it happens every night

Ah aaaaah present company
Excluded every time
Ah aaaaaah present company
The best that you can find

Talking like a jerk
Except you are an actual jerk
And living proof that sometimes friends are mean

Present company expect it present company
Just laugh it off it's better than it seems

Ah aaaaaah present company
Excluded in every way
Ah aaaaaah present company
Makes me wanna stay

Killing it with close inspection
Killing it can only make it worse
It sort of makes it breed
Present company accepting
Presently we all expect the worst
Works just like a need

Ah aaaaah present company
Excluded in the night
Ah aaaaah present company
Included in the fight

Ah aaaaaaaah, ah aaaaaaaah, aaaaaah
Ah aaaaaaah

Don't you want me to wake up?
Then give me just a bit of your time
Arguments are made for make-ups
So give it just a little more time

We've got to bring our resources
I wanna play it 'til the time comes
Forget your string of divorces
Just go and throw your little hands up

I miss the way the night comes
With friends who always make it feel good
This basement has a cold glow
Though it's better than a bunch of others

So go and dance yourself clean... ooow
Go and dance yourself clean yeah
You're blowing Marxism to pieces
Their little arguments to pieces

It's your show [x4]

Put your little feet doooooooooooown and haaaaaaaang out

Every night's a different story
It's a thirty car pile-up with you
Everybody's getting younger
It's the end of an era, it's true

And you go
(Stop, stop, stop, stop)

Break me into bigger pieces
So some of me is home with you
Wait until the weekend
And we can make our bad dreams come true

And it's ago yeah, it's ago
And if we wait until the weekend
We can miss the best things to do, oh

Go and dance yourself clean
Go and dance yourself clean
You're throwing marks into pieces
Maybe they're arguments the pieces

Oh

We should try a little harder
In the tedious march of the few
Every day's a different warning
There's a part of me hoping it's true


"Drunk Girls"

Drunk girls [x4]

(Drunk girls)
Drunk girls cause a couple of heart attacks
(Drunk girls)
Drunk girls are unusually mild
(Drunk boys)
Drunk boys keep in pace with the pedophiles
(Drunk girls)
Drunk girls are boringly wild

(Drunk girls)
Drunk girls get invitations from nations
(Drunk girls)
They got the patience of a million saints
(Drunk boys)
They steal, they steal from the cupboards
(Drunk girls)
Drunk girls like to file complaints

(Drunk girls)
Drunk girls are like a night of simplicity
(Drunk girls)
They need a lover who is smarter than me
(Drunk boys)
Drunk boys, we walk like pedestrians
(Drunk girls)
Drunk girls wait an hour to pee

(Drunk girls)
Drunk girls know that love is an astronaut
(Drunk girls)
It comes back, but it's never the same
(Drunk boys)
Drunk boys, drunk boys, drunk boys, drunk boys
(Drunk girls)
Drunk girls can be just as insane

Oh oh oh
I believe in waking up together
So oh oh
That means making eyes across the room

(Drunk girls)
Just 'cause I'm shallow doesn't mean that I'm heartless
(Drunk girls)
Just 'cause I'm heartless doesn't mean that I'm mean
(Drunk boys)
Sometimes love gives us too many options
(Drunk girls)
Just 'cause you're hungry doesn't mean that you're lean

(Drunk girls)
I've heard lies that could curdle your heartstrings
(Drunk girls)
A couple truths, maybe burn out your eyes
(Drunk boys)
Drunk boys leave their irons in the fireplace
(Drunk girls)
'Cause drunk girls give them too many tries

Drunk girls, drunk girls, drunk girls, drunk girls...

Oh oh oh
I believe in waking up together
Oh oh oh
I believe I'm waking up, but no promises
Oh oh oh
I believe in waiting out the weather
Oh oh oh
I believe in making up

The day becomes the night [x4]
Honestly, honestly, honestly
Unless it hurts, why do it?
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Oh

"One Touch"

I don't think that we will be pleased with this
We have waited for a long time
I recall the promises made to us
We've been patient for a long time

One touch is never enough
You gave the opening, opening
One touch is never enough
People who need people, to the back of the bus

I don't see how we could be pleased with this
We've been waiting for a long time
I recall the promises made to us
We've been patient such a long time

No one is dangerous
We are not dangerous
Unless we get a closer view

One touch is never enough
People need to move to the back of the bus
One touch is never enough
Complicated people never do what you're told to

One touch is never enough
People will need this in the back of the bus
One touch is never enough
People who need people are just people who need people

One touch is never enough
One touch is never enough
One touch is never enough
People who need people are just people who need people

I don't think that we will be pleased with this
We have waited such a long time
There's no way that we can be pleased with this
We've been waiting such a long time

We've been waiting such a long time
We've been waiting such a long time
This is getting sort of unreasonable
But we've been waiting a very long time

One touch is never enough
One touch is never enough
One touch is never enough
One touch is never enough

One touch is never enough
One touch is never enough
One touch is never enough
People who need people, to the back of the bus

No one is dangerous
No one is dangerous
Until we get a closer view


"All I Want"

Wait for the day you come home from the lonely part
And look for the girl who has put up with all of your shit
You never have needed anyone for so long

You learn in your bed you've been gone for too long
To put in the time, but it's too late to make it strong

Now all I want is your pity
Or all I want is your bitter tears
Yeah, all I want is your pity
Or at least all I want are your bitter tears

All I want is your pity
Or all I want are your bitter tears
Yeah, all I want is your pity
Or all I want are your bitter tears

Wake with a start
And the dog and the girl are gone
So you pack up your things
And head into the lame unknown
You never had needed anything for so long

And now all I want is your pity
And all I want are your bitter tears
Now all I want is your pity
And all I want are your bitter tears

From now on, I'm someone different
Cuz it's no fun to be predictably lame
From now on, let's do it different
Cuz I just want what I want

Take me home
Take me home
Take me home
Take me home


"I Can Change"

Tell me a line make it easy for me
Open your arms
Dance with me until I feel all right
It's good in the dark, good in the dark
But into the lover's light
Here comes another fight

So ring the alarm, ring the alarm
Bar me and hold me and cling to my arm
Here it comes, here it comes

And what you're asking me now, disastrous now
Hoping and hoping and hoping
The feeling goes away

Never change, never change, never change, never change
Never change, never change, never change
This is why I fell in love oooh

Never change, never change, never change, never change
Never change, never change, never change
That's just too up there in love with
(in love...)

This is the time the very best time
So give me a line and take me home
Take me over

But dashing the hopes dashing the hopes
And smashing the pride
The morning's got you on the ropes .. ooh

And love is a murderer, love is a murderer
But if she calls you tonight
Everything is all right
Yeah, we know
And love is a curse shoved in a hearse
Love is an open book to a verse of your bad poetry
And this is coming from me

But I can change, I can change, I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change, I can change
If it helps you fall in love
(fall in love)
[repeat]

Turn on the light make it easy for me
Fill the divide fumble in the kitchen
Til it's right
What an awful sight

But there's love in your eyes
Love in your eyes, love in your eyes
But maybe that's just what your lover finds
All night!

And I can change, I can change, I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change, I can change
If it helps you fall in love
(fall in love)
[repeat]

"You Wanted A Hit"

You wanted a hit
But maybe we don't do hits
I try and try
It ends up feeling kind of wrong

You wanted it tough
But is it ever tough enough?
No, nothing's ever tough enough
Until we hit the road

Yeah, you wanted it lush
But honestly you must hush
No honestly you know too much
So leave us, leave us on our own

And so you wanted a hit
Well, this is how we do hits
You wanted the hit
But that's not what we do

You wanted it real
But can you tell me what's real?
There's lights and sounds and stories
Music's just a part

Yeah, you wanted the truth
And then you said you want proof
I guess you're used to liars
Saying what they want

And we won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies
'Til you take us home

No, we won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies anymore
We can't be your babies
'Til you take us home

Yeah, you wanted it smart
But honestly I'm not smart
No, honestly we're never smart
We fake it, fake it all the time

Yeah, you wanted the time
But maybe I can't do time
Oh, we both know that's an awful line
But it doesn't make it wrong

You wanted it right
No out of mind and out of sight
No dirty bus and early flight
No seven days and forty nights

Yeah, you wanted a hit
But tell me where's the point in it?
You wanted the hit
But that's not what we do

And we won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies
'Til you take us home

No, we won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies anymore
We can't be your babies 
'Til you take us home

And we won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies
'Til you take us home

No, we won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies anymore
We can't be your babies 
'Til you take us home

"Pow Pow"

From this position
I will relax
From this position
I can see the whole place

From this position
Oh, just relax
From this position
I make some stand
I make my peace with the man

And it goes pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow
It goes pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow

From this position
I can see both of them
From this position
I totally get how the decision was reached

From this position
I can say "serious" or "cop-out" or "hard to define"
From this position, from this position
It's kind of like eating myself to death

You on the outside
Me on the inside
There's advantage to both

And me being uptight
And you being all right
There's advantages to each

From this perspective, from this position
I have a good grip on both of them
Because I have stayed home and have learned a little more about my neighbourhood, which is important
You know, there's a lot of good places to eat

So it goes pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow

So it's pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow
It goes pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow

With you on the keystroke
And me in the gang blank
There's advantages to both

And you have been all right
And I have been filmed being ridiculous
Oh, eat it, Michael Musto
You're no Bruce Valance

I have been untied
And you are all cross-eyed
There's advantages to each

And I'm coming back, coming back, coming back
Until there's nothing left in the well
Is that what they call it, the well?

I'm paralyzed and looking through you
But if nothing's right, we try anyway

As we compromised an arrogant person
I'm amazed at my decision to blame

On this occasion, there are a couple of things that we know that we learned from fact magazine
One, the king wears a king hat and lives in a king house
Two, your time will come, but tonight is our night, so you should give us all of your drugs
Three, we have a black president and you do not, so shut up,
because you don't know shit about where I'm from that you didn't get from your TV

So times have been tough, and times have been tough
You have been put down, washed up, erased out
But honestly, and be honest with yourself, how much time do you waste?
How much time do you blow every day?

So pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow
Oh, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow

So pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow

The return of the police

With you on the inside
Me on the outside
There's advantages to both

With me being wired
And you being tired
There's advantages to each

From this position, I feel affinity for the both of them, which is confusing
But honestly, I should be careful because otherwise, I'm being, I'm being, you know, what's it called?
Oh, fuck it

Reclining, I'm getting used to it
Like kissing under a bridge
It's an entirely new discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery

A couple of weeks at home
And then a couple of weeks away
And then home and away, again
To use up your desire for discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery

For an instant, you could have pushed through
But it's a plagiarized regret anyway
But what you want for now is someone to feel you
And that's the thing you like, is planning to stay

The return of the police!

"Somebody's Calling Me"

Somebody's calling me to be my girl
Somebody's calling me to be my girl
But my hands don't work; they're more like feet
And the wake-up call, "go back to sleep"

Babe, come with me
And I'll take you to the place I sleep
Oh, darling, come with me
And I'll show you the place I sleep

Somebody's phoning me to be my girl
Somebody's phoning me to be my girl
But the phone won't ring when I'm on the street
And the heart won't beat when I'm half asleep

Somebody's texting me to be my girl
Constantly texting me to be my girl
But the text won't take away nights that creep
And my mouth won't move when I'm in too deep

Babe, come with me
And I'll take you to the place I sleep
Oh, darling, come with me
And I'll show you the place I sleep

All right

Somebody's calling me into their work
Wrapped up and full of good inside their work
But the car won't start when I'm half asleep
And the kids don't cry when you're on your feet

Babe, come with me
And I'll show you the place I sleep
Oh, darling, come with me
And I'll take you to the place I live
The place I live
The place I live
The place I live
The places where I live

"Home"

Home
Home
Home
Home
Home
Home
Take me home

Just do it right
Make it perfect and real
Because it's everything
No everything was never the deal

So grab your things and stumble into the night
So we can shut the door
Oh, shut the door on terrible times

Yeah, do it right
And head again into space
So you can carry on
And carry on, and fall all over the place

This is the trick, forget a terrible year
That we can break the laws
Until it gets weird

And this is what you waited for
But under lights, we're all unsure
So tell me
What would make you feel better?

As night has such a local ring
And love and rock are pick-up things
And you know it
Yeah, you know it
Yeah, you know

Take

Forget your past
This is your last chance now
And we can break the rules
Like nothing will last

You might forget
Forget the sound of a voice
Still you should not forget
Yeah, don't forget
The things that we laughed about

And after rolling on the floor
And thankfully, a few make sure that you get home
And you stay home
And you better

'Cause you're afraid of what you need
Yeah, you're afraid of what you need
If you weren't, yeah you weren't
Then I don't know what we'd talk about

Yeah no one ever knows what you're talking about
So i guess you're already there
No one opens up when you scream and shout
But it's time to make a couple things clear

If you're afraid of what you need
If you're afraid of what you need
Look around you, you're surrounded
It won't get any better

Until the night
